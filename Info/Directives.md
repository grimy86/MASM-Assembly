# Directives
Directives are commands recognized by the compiler used for assembling the program.
- NOT part of the intel instruction set. Recognized by the MASM assembler itself, rather than actual CPU instructions that the processor executes.
- DO NOT execute at runtime
- NOT case sensitive

## Two main MASM directives
.data - contains identifiers
.code - contains the instructions
